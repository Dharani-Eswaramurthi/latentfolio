# LatentFolio Free

An evidence-first Astro portfolio starter for AI, ML, and GenAI engineers. It helps technical professionals explain the problem, engineering decisions, evaluation method, and outcome behind their work—not just list tools.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.23.4 or later
- npm 10 or later

## Start locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the production checks:

```bash
npm test
npm run audit
npm run build
npm run preview
```

You can also start a new Astro project directly from this repository after it is public:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template Dharani-Eswaramurthi/latentfolio
```

## Customize

The seller's hosted demo includes an optional Pro comparison banner. Buyer/fork builds hide it by default. Set `TEMPLATE_DEMO=false` to explicitly disable it; `true` is for the creator's demo. It also activates for the exact creator-owned `SITE_URL` origin or Vercel production hostname `latentfolio.vercel.app` unless explicitly disabled. When `SITE_URL` is unset, Vercel builds use the platform's production hostname for canonical URLs.

1. Replace the fictional profile, projects, experience, skills, writing, and education in `src/data/site.ts`.
2. Replace `public/avatar-placeholder.svg`, `public/resume-placeholder.pdf`, `public/og-cover.svg`, and `public/og-cover.png`.
3. Set `SITE_URL` to the exact public production origin in your deployment environment.
4. Update the favicon and web manifest, then test every email and external link.
5. Run `npm run build` and inspect the site on mobile and desktop in both themes.

Do not publish claims or metrics you cannot substantiate. If work is confidential, describe the evaluation method and use an approved range or qualitative outcome.

## Deploy

The output is static and can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or another static host. For Vercel, import the repository, keep the Astro defaults, add `SITE_URL`, and redeploy so canonical and social URLs use the production origin.
